# ftrack_performance_tests
Comparison of Ftrack API to Sqlalchemy and raw SQL

For our raw SQL tests, we're using [MySQLdb](http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html).  
Feel free to use your own driver, but if you want to test with MySQLdb it should be as easy as:

```
pip install MySQL-python
```
